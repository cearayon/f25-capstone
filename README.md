### NAME: console.log() Reviews

### ABOUT THIS APP:
This is my first fullstack app that I created independently as a capstone project for my Foundations 25 course during my time at Devmountain.
It's a simple app that lets you view and create video game review cards, similar to the reviews section in the Steam App.
As an avid gamer, I took inspiration from several gaming sites, apps, and blogs for my design.
My educational purpose for this app as to create a fully functioning app with a front-end, back-end, and to utilize an API.
Once those were functioning, I spent most of the extra time diving deep into CSS styling with animations, button hovers, and navbar menu creation.
